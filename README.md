# Bitcoin Live Graph


## What it can do:
	- Plays You Suffer by Napalm Death when Bitcoin is dropping
	- Makes a nice graph
	
## What it can't do:
	- Make a breakfast
	- Run both python files at the same time (you can but they cant access the """database""" so it wont work)
	
No right reserved

Used for the """project""":
	- [dash](www.dash.org)
	- [Bitcoin](https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/bitcoin/)
	- A lot of tutorials
