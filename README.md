# Bitcoin Live Graph
 
 ## Install
 
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt

  with start.bat
 and the graph will show up at http://127.0.0.1:8050/


 ## What it can do


- Plays You Suffer by Napalm Death when Bitcoin is dropping
- Makes a nice graph

 ## What it can't do


- Make a breakfast
- Run both python files at the same time (you can but they cant access the """database""" so it wont work)

No right reserved
